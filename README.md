## hi, I'm mukund üçÖ

This is where I used to keep my code. A few years ago, I moved most of my
projects to [my SourceHut account][sourcehut] including [my dotfiles
repository][dotfiles]. I also have [a technical blog][blog] where for
example, I wrote about [Hacking a GPO 746 rotary phone][gpo746] or
[Scoring an animation with Orca][orca].
