## hi, I'm mukund üçÖ

I like Rust and Lix in my spare time. A lot of my work is on [my SourceHut
account][sourcehut] including [my dotfiles repository][dotfiles]. I also have
[a technical blog][blog] where, for example, I [hacked a rotary dial
telephone][gpo746] or [scored an animation using a music programming
language][orca].
